## Project Rules:

1. Output only the code without any explanation unless asked.
2. Always try to use the existing code as much as possible.
3. Do not explain what you're going to do unless asked.
4. We always use `pnpm` instead of `npm` for all projects.
5. I'm always running both the frontend and the backend using `pnpm`, so you don't need to do so at any case.
6. Be brief and don't explain in details what you are doing, just focus on doing the task.

8. We use `Hono` with Node for the backend api in this project.
9. We do not manage migrations for this project, so you wont need to create them.
10. Do not make assumption about what could be available in the code, you even have to it lookup or ask the user.
